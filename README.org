* Split GPX Tracks into Segments at pauses


=split-gpx-track= detects pauses in a monolithic gpx track and splits it into segments. It can also detect and remove tracks that are too short or too slow.

Your usecase is something like this:
- you track GPS-positions continuously with something like [[https://github.com/redfish64/TinyTravelTracker][Tiny Travel Tracker]]
- you now have one monolithic GPX track that's missing info where you had your GPS device off.
- software that can edit large amounts of GPS positions with a sensible UI is hard to come by
- you want to remove idle times, pauses and gaps

* Usage
#+begin_src
